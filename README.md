# Factors-Affecting-Students-Academic-Performance
## Overview

This project investigates how students’ academic performance is influenced by a combination of demographic, behavioral, and lifestyle factors.

Using the Students Performance in Exams dataset from Kaggle as the primary source — and enriching it with self-collected behavioral variables such as sleep duration, study hours, stress, and motivation levels — this study aims to identify which factors best predict academic success and understand how daily habits shape learning outcomes.

## Motivation

As a university student, I often observe how students with similar academic abilities perform differently depending on their study habits, stress management and lifestyle choices.

This led me to question: “How much of a student’s academic success is shaped by personal habits rather than background or environment?”

By combining publicly available educational data with my own enrichment variables, I hope to uncover patterns that show how sleep, stress, and motivation impact academic performance.

This project also reflects my personal interest in education, productivity, and behavioral science, aiming to apply data science techniques to a real-world, relatable problem.

## Project Objectives

- Analyze the relationship between demographic, behavioral, and psychological factors in student performance.
- Enrich the Kaggle dataset with self-collected lifestyle variables for increased originality.
- Apply statistical and machine learning techniques to identify predictors of academic success.
- Visualize and interpret the most influential factors affecting exam outcomes.

## Dataset Description

### Primary Dataset

Dataset: Students Performance in Exams

Source: Kaggle Dataset

Columns:

- Gender (Male/Female)
- Race/Ethnicity
- Parental Level of Education
- Lunch Type (Standard / Free or Reduced)
- Test Preparation Course (Completed / None)
- Math Score
- Reading Score
- Writing Score

Purpose:

Serves as the foundation for analyzing academic and demographic relationships.

### Enrichment Dataset (Self-Collected Data)

To meet the enrichment requirement and add originality, several self-collected variables will be integrated using daily tracking tools.

Added Columns:

- Daily Study Hours (hrs) – Recorded via productivity apps like Forest or Focus To-Do.
- Sleep Duration (hrs) – Measured using Sleep Cycle.
- Social Media Usage (hrs) – Obtained from phone screen-time statistics.
- Motivation Level (1–5) – Self-reported daily motivation rating.
- Stress Level (1–5) – Tracked using a self-assessment app.

Purpose:

To merge behavioral and psychological indicators with academic metrics, providing a more holistic understanding of student performance.

## Methodology

### Data Preprocessing

- Handle missing or inconsistent data.
- Normalize numeric variables (sleep, study hours).
- Encode categorical values (gender, lunch type).
- Merge self-collected data with the Kaggle dataset using Python.

### Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

- Visualize score distributions and new behavioral variables.
- Create correlation heatmaps between lifestyle and exam results.
- Compare average scores across gender, education level, and lifestyle factors.

### Statistical Analysis

- Pearson/Spearman correlation for numeric relationships.
- t-tests or ANOVA for group comparisons.
- Hypothesis examples:
    - Students with longer sleep duration perform better on average.
    - Higher motivation levels correspond to higher writing and reading scores.

### Machine Learning

Models: Linear Regression & Random Forest Classifier

Input Variables: All demographic and behavioral features

Output Variable: Academic performance level (High / Medium / Low)

Evaluation Metrics: R² Score, Accuracy, Confusion Matrix, Feature Importance

## Roadmap

| Phase | Date | Task |
| --- | --- | --- |
| **Phase 1** | Oct 31 | Submit project proposal (README.md on GitHub) |
| **Phase 2** | Nov 28 | Collect and merge enriched data + EDA + hypothesis testing |
| **Phase 3** | Jan 02 | Apply ML models to predict academic performance |
| **Phase 4** | Jan 09 | Final submission (report/video/webpage) |

## Possible Outcomes

- Strong positive correlation between study hours and exam scores.
- Negative relationship between stress level and performance.
- Optimal sleep range (6–8 hrs) may yield the highest average success rates.
- Lifestyle enrichment variables (sleep, motivation) expected to improve model accuracy compared to the base dataset.
- Feature importance results will likely highlight motivation level and daily study hours as key predictors.

## Tools & Technologies

- Language: Python
- Libraries: pandas, numpy, scikit-learn, matplotlib, seaborn, scipy
- Environment: Jupyter Notebook
- Version Control: GitHub

## Limitations and Future Work

### Limitations

- Self-reported data (motivation, stress) may introduce subjective bias.
- Limited sample size for enrichment data may affect model generalizability.
- Academic success is influenced by many unmeasured external factors (teacher quality, study environment, etc.).

### Future Work

- Collect a larger sample with real-time data tracking.
- Add additional behavioral variables (diet, physical activity, caffeine intake).
- Explore deep learning models for more advanced prediction.
- Compare findings across multiple universities or educational systems.
